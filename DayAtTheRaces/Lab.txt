A day at the races.

This lab gives you a spec that describes a program
for you to build, using the knowledge you’ve gained
over the last few chapters.
This project is bigger than the ones you’ve seen so far.
So read the whole thing before you get started, and
give yourself a little time. And don’t worry if you get
stuck—there’s nothing new in here, so you can move
on in the book and come back to the lab later.
We’ve filled in a few design details for you, and we’ve
made sure you’ve got all the pieces you need…and
nothing else.
It’s up to you to finish the job. You can download
an executable for this lab from the website…but we
won’t give you the code for the answer.
